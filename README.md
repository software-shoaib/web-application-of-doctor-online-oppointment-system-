# web-application-of-doctor-online-oppointment-system-
<!-- This project aims to facilitate the process of requesting and managing medical appointments for clients/patients at a specific healthcare facility like a clinic or hospital. It provides an online platform where patients can request appointments with doctors, and doctors can effectively manage their schedules. The system organizes and schedules each patient's appointment based on their selected doctor. The project involves three key stakeholders: the administrator, doctors, and patients. The system administrator is responsible for maintaining a list of doctors, including their specialties, details, and system credentials. Patients can access the doctor's appointment system website to search for doctors based on their specific medical needs. They can also check the doctor's weekly schedule to find a suitable day and time for their appointment and then submit a request. Doctors, on the other hand, have access to all their appointments and can review the appointment requests from patients to determine their availability. -->
